# Real-Time Multi-Room Chat Application (MERN + Socket.io)

## Description

A full-stack real-time chat platform built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and Socket.io for instant communication.

## Objectives

- Apply full MERN stack development in a real-world project.
- Integrate real-time communication using Socket.io.
- Implement authentication and role-based access (normal user vs. admin).
- Showcase advanced features: room search, join requests, admin approval, message editing/deleting.

## Functional Requirements

### Authentication & User Management

**User Registration:**

- Required fields:
  - Username (unique, 3-50 characters, trimmed)
  - Email (unique, validated with regex pattern, converted to lowercase)
  - Password (minimum 8 characters, hashed with bcrypt using salt rounds of 10)
- Email validation pattern enforced
- Duplicate email/username checking
- Returns user info (username, email, createdAt) on successful registration

**User Login:**

- Authentication via email and password
- JWT token generation with userId and username payload
- Token expiration controlled by JWT_LIFETIME environment variable
- Returns user info and token on successful login
- Password verification using bcrypt comparison

**User Profile Management:**

- Get user information (protected route)
- Update profile:
  - Username (minimum 3 characters, uniqueness check)
  - Email (validation + uniqueness check)
  - Automatic updatedAt timestamp
- Update password:
  - Requires current password verification
  - New password minimum 8 characters
  - Password re-hashed on update

**Authorization:**

- JWT-based authentication middleware
- Bearer token format in Authorization header
- Token verification on protected routes
- User context (userId, username) attached to requests

---

### Chat Room Management

**Room Creation:**

- Creator automatically becomes Admin
- Required fields:
  - Name (3-100 characters, trimmed, lowercase)
  - Description (trimmed, lowercase)
  - Category (3-100 characters, trimmed, lowercase)
- Creator automatically added to members array
- Empty requests array initialized
- Timestamps (createdAt) automatically generated

**Admin Powers:**

- Approve join requests (remove from requests, add to members)
- Reject join requests (remove from requests array)
- Remove members from room
- Delete entire room
- Update room information (name, description, category)
- Admin verification required for all admin actions

**Room Discovery:**

- Get all rooms
- Search room by exact name match
- Filter rooms by category
- All searches case-insensitive (lowercase conversion)

**Member Management:**

- Members stored as User ObjectId references
- Join requests stored separately from members
- Remove member functionality (admin only)
- Prevents duplicate memberships

---

### Room Search & Join Requests

**Search Functionality:**

- Search by room name (exact match, case-insensitive)
- Filter by category
- Returns room details including members and pending requests

**Join Request Flow:**

1. User sends join request via `/api/user/send-join-request`
2. Request added to room's requests array
3. Prevents duplicate requests
4. Checks if user is already a member
5. Admin receives notification (to be implemented with Socket.io)
6. Admin can approve or reject from `/api/room/approve-join-request` or `/api/room/reject-join-request`

**Leave Room:**

- Users can leave rooms they're members of
- Removes user from members array
- Validation checks for membership before removal

---

### Real-Time Chat

**Message System:**

- Messages stored in MongoDB with:
  - roomId (ObjectId reference)
  - senderId (ObjectId reference)
  - content (1-200 characters, trimmed)
  - isDeletedMessage (boolean flag)
  - isModifiedMessage (boolean flag)
  - Timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)

**Message Operations:**

- Send message: Creates new message document
- Edit message:
  - Updates content
  - Sets isModifiedMessage flag to true
  - Updates updatedAt timestamp
  - Only message owner can edit
- Delete message:
  - Soft delete (content replaced with "This message has been deleted")
  - Sets isDeletedMessage flag to true
  - Owner or room admin can delete
  - Prevents duplicate deletions

**Real-Time Features (To Implement):**

- Socket.io integration for instant message delivery
- Room-based socket channels
- Join request notifications
- Member updates
- Real-time message updates

- **15 messages** - Distributed across different rooms

Use this data for development and testing by importing into MongoDB.

**Standard Error Responses:**

- `400 Bad Request` - Validation errors, missing fields
- `401 Unauthorized` - Invalid credentials, missing/invalid token
- `404 Not Found` - Resource not found
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Database/server errors

**Consistent Format:**

```json
{
  "msg": "Error message description"
}
```

**Success Responses:**

- `200 OK` - Successful GET/UPDATE
- `201 Created` - Successful POST (resource created)
- Include relevant data in response body

---

## Notes for Developers

1. All text fields are trimmed and converted to lowercase for consistency
2. Use ObjectId references for relationships between collections
3. Implement proper error handling in try-catch blocks
4. Validate user permissions before admin actions
5. Always check for duplicates before creating resources
6. Use bcrypt pre-save middleware for password updates
7. Implement socket.io for real-time features (next priority)
8. Consider implementing rate limiting for API endpoints
9. Add request logging for debugging
10. Implement comprehensive API documentation (Swagger/Postman)
